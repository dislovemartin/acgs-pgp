## **4. Integration Architectures (The Command Layer)**

**Abstract:** This section details the precise integration architectures for the ACGS-PGP Command Layer, encompassing internal component synergies and external system interfaces. It emphasizes quantum-resistant API security (CRYSTALS-Kyber), zero-knowledge processing modules, real-time data flows via Kafka/Flink, and specialized interfaces for formal verification engines and blockchain ledgers.

### **4.1. Internal Component Integration**

* **PGS-AI to Neo4j:** PGS-AI (Symbolic Module) writes validated P-IR graph structures to Neo4j via its GraphQL API (secured with PQC tokens).
* **Flink to PGS-AI & Neo4j:** Flink jobs trigger PGS-AI synthesis via internal API calls (or message queue events) and push P-IR diffs/updates to Neo4j.
* **RGE to Neo4j/CDN:** Edge RGEs fetch P-IR data from Akamai CDN. Cache misses or dynamic queries go to the central Neo4j instance via PQC-secured GraphQL.
* **Inference Gateway to RGE:** Low-latency internal gRPC calls (PQC-secured within trusted zones if possible, or PQC over public internet for edge RGEs) to pass context and receive AI Constitutions.
* **Inference Gateway to AuditKit (Fabric):** Asynchronous submission of compliance event logs to a Fabric client API endpoint or via a Kafka bridge to the Fabric ingestion service.
* **P-IR Management to Formal Verification Module:** APIs to submit P-IR clauses (with LTL annotations) to the NuSMV wrapper and receive verification results.

### **4.2. External System Integration**

* **Regulatory Feeds/Threat Intel to Kafka:** Secure ingestion points (e.g., Kafka Connectors, custom producers with API key auth) for external data providers.
* **Clients to Inference Gateway:** Public-facing REST/GraphQL API secured with CRYSTALS-Kyber for key exchange and standard TLS for session encryption.
* **Application LLMs to Inference Gateway:** Inference Gateway acts as a reverse proxy; uses standard API protocols of underlying LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API format). Secure credential management for these backend LLMs.
* **AuditKit UI/CLI to Fabric Query Layer:** PQC-secured REST/GraphQL API for querying audit data.
* **D-Wave Quantum Annealer Integration:** (For P-IR clause optimization prototype) Secure API calls from a dedicated optimization module to D-Wave Leap or similar quantum cloud service.

### **4.3. Zero-Knowledge & Cryptographic Integrations**

* **Homomorphic Encryption (HE) in RGE:**

  * **Workflow:** If a P-IR clause contains sensitive data that must be processed by RGE without decryption at the edge, it's pre-encrypted (e.g., using CKKS or BFV schemes) by the P-IR Management system.
  * **RGE Module:** The Wasm RGE includes HE libraries (e.g., Microsoft SEAL, PALISADE compiled to Wasm if feasible, or calls a microservice handling HE ops) to perform necessary computations (e.g., checks, aggregations) on encrypted P-IR data.
  * **Key Management:** Robust HE key management system is paramount, likely centralized and highly secured.
* **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) for PGS-AI:**

  * **Orchestration:** A dedicated SMPC coordinator service.
  * **Protocol:** Implements an SMPC protocol (e.g., SPDZ, GMW) allowing multiple (potentially untrusting) parties/nodes contributing to PGS-AI synthesis (e.g., each processes a subset of private regulatory docs) to compute the joint P-IR without revealing their individual inputs. Requires cryptographic libraries for SMPC.
* **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):**

  * **API Gateway & Inference Gateway:** Implement CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) during TLS handshake for all external facing APIs. Standard symmetric encryption (e.g., AES-256) for session data thereafter. Libraries like Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) can be used.

### **4.4. Formal Verification Integration**

* **P-IR Annotation:** P-IR clauses intended for formal verification will include LTL/CTL properties as metadata.
* **Formal Verification Module:**

  * A service that wraps NuSMV (or other model checkers like TLA+).
  * Receives P-IR clause ID and its LTL/CTL spec.
  * Translates relevant parts of the P-IR (the "model") and the LTL/CTL spec into NuSMV's input language.
  * Executes NuSMV, parses results (verified, counterexample).
  * Stores verification status and any counterexamples, linking back to the P-IR version.
* **Workflow:** Verification can be triggered upon P-IR clause creation/modification, before approval for high-stakes policies.

## **5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Zero-Trust Command**

**Abstract:** This section architects a formidable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism for the ACGS-PGP Command Layer. Grounded in uncompromising zero-trust tenets and cryptographic assurance, it ensures that all access rights are meticulously defined, cryptographically verified, and auditable on the blockchain, aligned with the system's advanced security posture.

### **5.1. Core Principles (Zero-Trust Command)**

* **Explicit Authorization:** No implicit trust. Every action on any resource requires explicit, verifiable authorization.
* **Least Privilege, Dynamically Assessed:** Permissions are minimal and can be dynamically scoped or augmented by attestations/claims where appropriate (e.g., short-lived cryptographic capabilities).
* **Identity Cryptographically Bound:** Identities (user, service, edge RGE) are bound to cryptographic keys (potentially PQC-resistant).
* **Policy as Code, Verifiable & Auditable:** RBAC policies themselves are version-controlled artifacts. Changes and enforcement decisions are logged immutably on the AuditKit's blockchain.
* **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) & Verifiable Credentials (VCs) - Exploration:** For advanced scenarios, particularly regulator access to AuditKit, explore DIDs and VCs for enhanced trust and interoperability.

### **5.2. RBAC Entities (Command Layer)**

* **Subject:** Users, services, RGE instances, PGS-AI modules. Each possesses a cryptographic identity.
* **Resource:** P-IR graphs/clauses, LTL specs, HE keys, SMPC tasks, AuditKit queries, specific Flink jobs, Application LLM configurations.
* **Permission:** Granular actions (e.g., pir\:graph\:read\_subgraph, pir\:ltl\:define\_critical, he\:key\:request\_decryption\_oracle, audit\:fabric\:query\_channel\_X, rge\:wasm\:deploy\_edge\_APAC).
* **Role:** Cryptographically defined collections of permissions, potentially represented as smart contracts or verifiable attestations. Examples:

  * RegulithPrime: Supreme system command.
  * PolicyArchitect\_Quantum: Can define P-IR structures, LTL specs, and manage HE/SMPC configurations.
  * PgsAiSymbiote\_NodeX: A participating node in SMPC-based P-IR synthesis, with specific data access rights.
  * RgeEdgeWarden\_RegionEU: Can deploy and manage RGE Wasm modules in the EU edge network.
  * FormalVerifierDaemon: Service identity for the NuSMV integration module.
  * AuditOracle\_RegulatorXYZ: A regulator identity with specific query rights on the AuditKit blockchain, potentially using VCs.

### **5.3. Implementation & Enforcement**

* **Central IAM Service (Fortified):** Manages core identity registration (linking public keys to roles/attributes). Uses PQC for its own APIs.
* **Smart Contracts for Roles/Permissions (Hyperledger Fabric - for key policies):** Certain high-level roles or critical permissions could be encoded in smart contracts on the AuditKit blockchain, making assignments and modifications transparent and subject to on-chain governance.
* **Token-Based Access (PQC-JWTs or VCs):** Short-lived access tokens (JWTs signed with PQC algorithms, or Verifiable Credentials) carry subject identity and authorized permissions/roles.
* **Distributed Enforcement:**

  * **API Gateways (PQC-Secured):** Initial token validation.
  * **Microservices/Serverless Functions:** Cryptographically verify tokens. For critical ops, may require multi-signature approval or re-attestation.
  * **Wasm RGEs (Edge):** Securely receive and validate short-lived capability tokens for accessing P-IR data or specific HE operations.
* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) - Complementary:** Augment RBAC with ABAC for fine-grained decisions based on context (e.g., data sensitivity, time of day, threat level from Inference Gateway's anomaly detector).

## **9. Development Roadmap (Phase Two Mandate & Beyond)**

**Abstract:** Regulith, this section details the actionable development roadmap, expanding upon Protocol IX's "Phase Two Roadmap" directive. It breaks down the ambitious goals into concrete Sprints/Epochs, focusing on iterative delivery of the ACGS-PGP Command Layer's advanced capabilities, from live RGE prototyping to global pilot deployments and pioneering quantum optimizations. Funding considerations (\$1.5M Full Vision vs. \$300K Skunkworks MVP) will dictate pace and feature depth per epoch.

**Assumed Funding Model for this Roadmap: \$1.5M Full Vision** (A Skunkworks MVP would drastically reduce scope, likely deferring most PQC, HE, SMPC, Formal Verification, and Quantum features to later, unfunded phases).
