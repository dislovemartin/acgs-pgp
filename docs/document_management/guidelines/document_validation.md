# ACGS-PGP Document Validation Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for validating documentation in the ACGS-PGP project.

## Document Metadata

- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Author:** [Author Name]
- **Status:** Approved

## Validation Process

Document validation is a critical part of maintaining high-quality documentation. The validation process ensures that documents meet the project's standards for structure, content, and formatting.

### Automated Validation

The ACGS-PGP project includes automated validation tools to check documents against quality guidelines. These tools can be found in the `docs/document_management/scripts/` directory.

#### Running the Validation Script

To validate a document or set of documents:

```bash
python docs/document_management/scripts/validate_documents.py [path]
```

Where `[path]` is an optional path to a specific Markdown file or directory. If no path is provided, all Markdown files in the repository will be validated.

#### Validation Rules

The validation script checks documents against the following rules:

1. **Document has a title (H1)** - Every document should start with a level 1 heading.
2. **Document has metadata section** - Every document should include a metadata section.
3. **Document has version information** - The metadata section should include version information.
4. **Document has last updated date** - The metadata section should include the last updated date.
5. **Document has author information** - The metadata section should include author information.
6. **Document has status information** - The metadata section should include status information.
7. **Document has no broken internal links** - All internal links should point to valid files.
8. **Document has no TODO markers** - Documents should not contain TODO or FIXME markers.
9. **Document has no empty sections** - Sections should contain content.
10. **Document has proper heading hierarchy** - Headings should follow a proper hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.).
11. **Code blocks have language specified** - Code blocks should specify the language for syntax highlighting.

### Manual Validation

In addition to automated validation, documents should be manually reviewed for:

1. **Accuracy** - The information in the document is correct and up-to-date.
2. **Completeness** - The document covers all necessary information.
3. **Clarity** - The document is clear and easy to understand.
4. **Consistency** - The document is consistent with other documentation.
5. **Relevance** - The document is relevant to its intended audience.

## Validation Workflow

1. **Automated Validation**
   - Run the validation script on the document
   - Address any errors or warnings

2. **Self-Review**
   - Review the document against the validation checklist
   - Make any necessary corrections

3. **Peer Review**
   - Have another team member review the document
   - Address any feedback

4. **Final Validation**
   - Run the validation script again to ensure all issues are resolved
   - Update the document status to "Approved" if appropriate

## Handling Validation Issues

When validation issues are identified:

1. **Errors** - Must be fixed before the document can be approved
2. **Warnings** - Should be addressed if possible, but may be acceptable in some cases
3. **Suggestions** - Consider implementing to improve document quality

Document the reason for any unresolved warnings or suggestions in the document's metadata section.
