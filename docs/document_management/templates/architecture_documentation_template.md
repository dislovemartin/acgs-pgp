## Overview

[Provide a high-level overview of the component/system, its purpose, and its role in the overall ACGS-PGP architecture]

## Architecture Diagram

[Include a diagram of the component/system architecture. Use Mermaid or PlantUML syntax for diagrams that can be rendered in Markdown]

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
    A --> C[Component C]
    B --> D[Component D]
    C --> D
```

## Components

### [Component Name]

[Describe the component, its purpose, and its responsibilities]

#### Interfaces

[Describe the interfaces exposed by the component]

#### Dependencies

[Describe the dependencies of the component]

#### Data Model

[Describe the data model used by the component]

#### Behavior

[Describe the behavior of the component, including any state machines, algorithms, or processes]

## Interactions

[Describe how the components interact with each other and with external systems]

### [Interaction Name]

[Describe the interaction, including sequence diagrams if appropriate]

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Component A
    participant B as Component B
    A->>B: Request
    B->>A: Response
```

## Data Flow
