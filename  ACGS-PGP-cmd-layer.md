### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1. Purpose
This document specifies the definitive JSON schema for the Prompt Intermediate Representation (P-IR) Version 2.0, as conceptualized within the ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0. The P-IR is a structured, machine-executable format embodying governance policies, designed for synthesis by the Hybrid PGS-AI and enforcement by the Wasm-based Runtime Governance Engine (RGE). It is central to achieving "Compliance by Designâ€”executable, auditable, and immutable" [ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 1.0].

#### 1.2. Scope
This schema applies to all P-IRs generated, stored, versioned (in Neo4j), streamed (via Kafka/Flink), and enforced within the ACGS-PGP Command Layer. It underpins the entire governance lifecycle, from regulatory text ingestion to runtime AI Constitution compilation.

#### 1.3. Audience
(As previously defined, with added emphasis on teams working with Neo4j, Wasm RGE, Formal Verification, and Quantum Optimization modules.)

#### 1.4. Definitions
*   **P-IR:** Prompt Intermediate Representation (v2.0).
*   **PGS-AI:** Hybrid Governance Synthesizer AI (Llama/Grok + Symbolic + SMPC, orchestrated by AIQ Toolkit).
*   **RGE:** Runtime Governance Engine (Wasm-based, GPU-accelerated, HE-capable).
*   **LTL:** Linear Temporal Logic (for formal property specification).
*   **CTL:** Computation Tree Logic (alternative temporal logic).
*   **HE:** Homomorphic Encryption.
*   **PQC:** Post-Quantum Cryptography.
*   **Neo4j:** Graph database for storing P-IRs as a knowledge graph.
*   **AIQ Toolkit:** Agent Intelligence Toolkit used for PGS-AI workflow development.

#### 1.5. Document Versioning & Relation to ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0
This P-IR Schema Document (v2.0) directly implements and elaborates upon the P-IR concepts described in ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0, particularly Section 2.3 ("The P-IR: Compilable Governance Artifacts").

### 2. P-IR Core Philosophy & Design Principles

The P-IR v2.0 design adheres to the following principles derived from ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0:

*   **2.1. Machine Executability:** Directly translatable into efficient Wasm RGE logic.
*   **2.2. Human Readability & Auditability:** Structured JSON with clear descriptions, linkable to source regulations and AI Constitution articles, and auditable via AuditKit.
*   **2.3. Extensibility:** Allows for new trigger types, action types, and metadata fields as governance needs evolve.
*   **2.4. Support for Formal Verification:** Includes dedicated fields for LTL/CTL annotations to enable model checking of policy properties [ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 2.2, 4.4].
*   **2.5. Integration with Cryptographic Primitives:** Supports fields for PQC signatures (for integrity/authenticity) and HE policies (for processing sensitive P-IR data within the RGE) [ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 4.3].
*   **2.6. Neo4j Graph Database Compatibility:** Schema elements are designed to map effectively to a graph structure (nodes for clauses, regulations; relationships for derivation, precedence) [ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 3.3].

### 4. Detailed Field Descriptions & Semantics

*(This section would elaborate on each field from the JSON schema above, providing examples and explaining its role, especially for new fields like `temporalLogicAnnotations`, `homomorphicEncryptionPolicy`, `quantumOptimizationHints`, and the PQC/FV fields within `metadata`. It would also detail how `triggerConditions.conditions.oneOf` works and the parameters for new `governanceActions` like `INVOKE_SECURE_GOVERNANCE_TOOL` and `INITIATE_SMPC_PROTOCOL`.)*

*   **`pirId` (string, uuid, required):** Immutable unique identifier for the logical P-IR.
*   **`versionId` (string, required):** Unique identifier for this *version* of the P-IR (e.g., `PIR_ID_v1.2.3` or a UUID). This is the primary key for the versioned P-IR node in Neo4j.
*   **`metadata.pqcSignature` (object):**
    *   `algorithm` (string, enum): Specifies the PQC signature algorithm used (e.g., `CRYSTALS-Dilithium2`, `Falcon-512`) as per ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 4.3.
    *   `signatureValue` (string, base64): The PQC signature of the canonicalized P-IR content (excluding the signature itself).
    *   `publicKeyId` (string): Identifier of the PQC public key used for verification.
*   **`metadata.formalVerification` (object):**
    *   `lastRunId` (string, uuid): Link to the AuditKit event ID of the last formal verification run for this P-IR version.
    *   `status` (string, enum): Current verification status.
    *   `verifiedProperties` (array of strings): List of `propertyId`s from `temporalLogicAnnotations` that have been successfully verified.
*   **`metadata.synthesisDetails.aiqWorkflowRunId` (string):** If synthesized via AIQ Toolkit, the run ID of the AIQ workflow.
*   **`scope.customAttributes` (array of `ContextAttributeMatcher`):** Allows for complex, reusable attribute-based scoping conditions.
*   **`triggerConditions.conditions.oneOf`:** Each item in the `conditions` array must match one of the defined matcher schemas (e.g., `PromptPatternMatcher`, `AnomalyScoreMatcher`).
*   **`triggerConditions.conditions[...].AnomalyScoreMatcher`:**
    *   `source` (string, enum): Indicates the origin of the anomaly score (e.g., `INFERENCE_GATEWAY_ISOLATION_FOREST`).

    *   `fieldsToEncrypt` (array of string JSONPaths): Specifies which P-IR fields (e.g., sensitive patterns in `triggerConditions`) should be stored/transmitted encrypted and processed by the RGE using HE.
    *   `heSchemeId` (string): Identifier for the HE scheme (e.g., `BFV_SET1`, `CKKS_SET2`) and parameters managed by a Crypto Service/KMS.
*   **`quantumOptimizationHints` (object):** [ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 2.3]
    *   `quboFormulationHint` (string): Provides guidance to the D-Wave interface on how to translate this P-IR (or parts of it) into a QUBO model for optimization tasks (e.g., optimal clause selection under constraints).
    *   `targetObjective` (string): The objective this P-IR contributes to when considered for quantum optimization (e.g., "minimize_risk_score_X").

### 5. P-IR Lifecycle Statuses & Transitions

*   **`DRAFT`**: Initial creation, or after rejection/superseding if being revised.
*   **`PENDING_VALIDATION`**: Submitted for human expert review (legal, ethical, technical).
*   **`PENDING_FV`**: (Optional state after validation) Submitted for formal verification if LTL/CTL annotations are present and FV is mandated.
*   **`ACTIVE`**: Approved, (optionally) formally verified, and live for RGE enforcement.
*   **`SUPERSEDED`**: Replaced by a new `versionId` of the same `pirId`. Not active.
*   **`ARCHIVED`**: No longer relevant, kept for historical audit. Not active.
*   **`REJECTED`**: Failed validation or FV. Can be moved to `DRAFT` for revision or `ARCHIVED`.

```
*(Further examples for SMPC and Quantum Hints would follow similar detailed structures, referencing their specific parameters as outlined in section 4.)*

### 7. Schema Versioning and Evolution Strategy
(As previously defined, emphasizing that P-IR v2.0 is a major version change due to the introduction of LTL, HE, PQC, and advanced trigger/action types. Migration scripts and RGE backward compatibility (or phased rollout) will be critical.)

### 3. Component Architecture Details (Elaborating on ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 3.2)

#### 3.1. Echelon 1: Global Policy Intelligence & Synthesis
*   **3.1.1. External Feeds & Kafka/Flink Pipeline:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Ingest diverse external data (regulatory updates, threat intelligence feeds like STIX/TAXII, internal policy documents). Normalize data into a `NormalizedRegulationEvent` schema. Perform real-time analysis (e.g., diffing against existing P-IR knowledge graph in Neo4j) using Apache Flink to identify significant changes. Trigger P-IR synthesis workflows in PGS-AI via Kafka.
    *   **Technologies:** Apache Kafka, Kafka Connectors, Apache Flink (SQL/DataStream API).
*   **3.1.2. Hybrid PGS-AI (Llama/Grok + Symbolic AI + SMPC, AIQ Toolkit Orchestration):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Translate `NormalizedRegulationEvent` or direct policy intents into structured P-IR v2.0 objects. This involves:
        *   **LLM Intent Extraction (AIQ Tool):** Fine-tuned Llama/Grok (4-bit quantized, running as a NIM or similar inference server) extracts entities, relationships, deontic modalities, and draft P-IR structures.
        *   **Symbolic Refinement & LTL Annotation (AIQ Tool):** Custom Python tool using Jena/RDF4J (for OWL/SHACL reasoning against a domain ontology) and potentially custom logic to refine LLM output, ensure consistency, and generate LTL/CTL annotations for formal properties.
        *   **SMPC Coordination (AIQ Tool/Service):** If synthesis involves private data from multiple parties, an SMPC protocol (e.g., based on SPDZ) is orchestrated to compute parts of the P-IR without revealing raw inputs.
        *   **P-IR Graph Construction (AIQ Tool):** Writes the validated and refined P-IR (with LTL, version info) to the Neo4j P-IR Graph DB.
    *   **Technologies:** AIQ Toolkit, Quantized LLMs (Llama/Grok), Jena/RDF4J/SHACL, Python, SMPC libraries, Kafka (for results/status).
*   **3.1.3. P-IR Graph Database (Neo4j):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Stores all versions of P-IRs as a graph. Nodes represent P-IR versions, clauses, source regulations, LTL properties, etc. Relationships define derivation, precedence, version history, and links to formal verification results. Enables complex querying for P-IR impact analysis, RGE policy selection, and audit.
    *   **Technologies:** Neo4j, Cypher, P-IR v2.0 schema mapped to graph properties.

#### 3.2. Echelon 2: Edge Governance Compilation & Enforcement
*   **3.2.1. Inference Gateway:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Secure external API endpoint for client applications. Caches frequently accessed P-IR subsets (from Neo4j via Akamai or internal cache). Performs anomaly detection on incoming requests (Isolation Forest). Orchestrates calls to Edge RGE. Terminates PQC for external APIs (CRYSTALS-Kyber). Manages asynchronous tasks with Celery/Redis for complex pre/post-processing if needed.
    *   **Technologies:** FastAPI/Python, Celery, Redis, Akamai (or Varnish/Nginx cache), Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest), liboqs integration.
*   **3.2.2. Wasm RGE (Runtime Governance Engine):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Deployed to serverless edge locations (AWS Lambda@Edge, Cloudflare Workers) or edge K8s. Executes P-IR logic with sub-millisecond latency.
        *   Receives context and P-IR reference from Inference Gateway.
        *   Loads/interprets relevant P-IR data (potentially HE encrypted parts).
        *   Uses DistilBERT (quantized ONNX/TensorRT) for semantic precedence between conflicting P-IR clauses.
        *   Parses and (partially, if feasible at edge) evaluates LTL/CTL conditions against runtime context.
        *   Performs HE operations (using SEAL/PALISADE wrappers) on encrypted P-IR fields.
        *   Compiles the final AI Constitution (system prompt) and governance decision.
    *   **Technologies:** Rust/C++ compiled to Wasm, Wasmtime/WasmEdge runtime, ONNX Runtime/TensorRT for DistilBERT (if Wasm supports GPU/NPU access or via host calls), HE library bindings.
*   **3.2.3. Application LLM Interface:** The Inference Gateway proxies requests to the target Application LLM, prepending the AI Constitution.
*   **3.2.4. AI Constitution Registry (OCI-Compliant):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Stores versioned, signed Wasm RGE modules (which are essentially pre-compiled AI Constitutions or RGE configurations specific to a set of P-IRs). Edge Orchestrator pulls updates from here.
    *   **Technologies:** OCI-compliant registry (e.g., Harbor, Docker Hub, ECR).

#### 3.3. Echelon 3: Immutable Audit & Verification
*   **3.3.1. AuditKit (Hyperledger Fabric):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Provides a tamper-proof, distributed ledger for all critical governance events (P-IR changes, RGE evaluations, FV results, access controls). Events are PQC-signed by their originating component. Offers CLI/UI for auditors and regulators. Supports audit replay.
    *   **Technologies:** Hyperledger Fabric, Go/Node.js (Chaincode), PQC library for signing.
*   **3.3.2. Formal Verification Module (NuSMV Wrapper):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Receives P-IR clauses with LTL/CTL annotations from P-IR Management/Flink. Translates them into NuSMV (.smv) model files. Invokes NuSMV to check properties. Reports verification status (VERIFIED, FALSIFIED with counterexample) back to Neo4j and AuditKit.
    *   **Technologies:** Python wrapper, NuSMV (or TLA+), LTL/CTL parsing libraries.

#### 3.4. Cross-Cutting Components
*   **3.4.1. Cryptographic Services:** Libraries/modules providing PQC (liboqs), HE (SEAL/PALISADE), and SMPC functionalities, integrated into relevant services. A dedicated Key Management Service (KMS), possibly integrating with Vault, manages the lifecycle of PQC/HE keys.
*   **3.4.2. Quantum Optimization Interface (D-Wave Leap API):** Python scripts/service to formulate P-IR optimization problems (e.g., clause selection under resource constraints) as QUBOs and submit them to D-Wave Leap for prototyping.
*   **3.4.3. Monitoring & Observability Stack:** Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing (especially within AIQ Toolkit workflows for PGS-AI).
*   **3.4.4. Identity Management (SPIFFE/SPIRE):** For strong, attestable service identities in a Zero-Trust environment, particularly for Wasm RGE instances at the edge. Complements user/API IAM.

*(The document would continue with sections 4-11, elaborating on data flows, specific data models for Neo4j/Fabric, detailed security measures for PQC/HE/SMPC, scalability targets for each echelon, K8s/Serverless deployment specifics, AIQ Toolkit integration patterns, and the quantum roadmap based on ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0.)*

## 3. ACGS-PGP: Platform-Wide API Design Guidelines (OpenAPI)

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Aligning with Regulith Command Cycle 2.0)
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Status:** DRAFT (Derived from ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 4.0)

**Table of Contents:** (Extending previous TOC with Spec v2.0 details)

1.  **Introduction**
    1.1. Purpose
    1.2. Scope (All ACGS-PGP APIs: REST, gRPC, GraphQL; Internal & External)
    1.3. Audience
    1.4. Guiding Principles (Consistency, Security by Design (PQC), Performance, Discoverability)
    1.5. Specification Versions (OpenAPI 3.x, gRPC Proto3, GraphQL Schema Definition Language)
2.  **API Design Philosophy**
    2.1. Protocol Selection Rationale (REST for external/management, gRPC for internal low-latency, GraphQL for Neo4j flexible queries)
    2.2. Design-First Approach
3.  **URL Structure and Naming Conventions (REST/GraphQL)**
    3.1. Base Path (e.g., `/acgs/api/{version}/{service-name}/`)
    3.2. Resource Naming (Plural, kebab-case)
    3.3. Versioning (URI for REST, potentially headers/schema evolution for GraphQL/gRPC)
4.  **HTTP Methods (REST) & gRPC Method Types & GraphQL Operations**
5.  **Request/Response Structure**
    5.1. Headers (Standard + `X-PQC-Signature-Alg`, `X-PQC-Signature`, `X-HE-Scheme-ID`)
    5.2. Body (JSON for REST/GraphQL, Protobuf for gRPC)
    5.3. Status Codes (HTTP) & gRPC Status Codes
    5.4. Standard Error Response Format (including PQC/HE error codes)
6.  **Data Types and Formats (including PQC/HE data representation)**
7.  **Pagination, Filtering, Sorting (GraphQL & REST)**
8.  **Security for APIs (ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 4.2, 4.3)**
    8.1. **Authentication:**
        *   External APIs (Inference Gateway): CRYSTALS-Kyber for KEM in TLS handshake, followed by JWT (PQC-signed if feasible) for application-level auth.
        *   Internal APIs (gRPC/REST): mTLS with PQC certificates (using SPIFFE/SPIRE identities) or PQC-signed JWTs.
    8.2. **Authorization:** RBAC enforced by API Gateway and individual services.
    8.3. **Data Integrity & Confidentiality:**
        *   PQC Signatures for critical messages/P-IRs.
        *   HE for specific sensitive fields in API payloads (clearly documented in OAS/Proto).
    8.4. Input Validation (against schemas, including cryptographic material format).
9.  **OpenAPI (for REST) / gRPC Proto / GraphQL Schema Best Practices**
    9.1. Clear definitions for PQC/HE related fields and security schemes.
10. **API Lifecycle Management (including PQC key rotation impact)**

---
*(Content for API Design Guidelines would elaborate on each point, focusing on how PQC, HE, and the different API styles (REST, gRPC, GraphQL) are consistently handled across the platform as per ACGS-PGP Spec v2.0 Sec 4.0.)*

**Example OpenAPI Security Scheme for PQC KEM + JWT:**

```yaml
# In components.securitySchemes of an OpenAPI document
components:
  securitySchemes:
    PQC_KEM_JWT:
      type: apiKey # This is a conceptual representation; actual flow is more complex
      in: header # The JWT is in the header
      name: Authorization
      description: |
        Authentication uses a two-fold approach for enhanced security:
        1. Initial connection establishment MAY be protected by a TLS layer incorporating a 
           Post-Quantum Cryptography Key Encapsulation Mechanism (PQC KEM) like CRYSTALS-Kyber.
           This secures the channel over which the JWT is then passed.
        2. The `Authorization` header carries a Bearer token (JWT). This JWT itself MIGHT be
           signed with a PQC algorithm if supported by the IAM service and client.
        The `scheme` is 'bearer', `bearerFormat` is 'JWT'. The PQC aspect primarily applies
        to the secure channel establishment or the JWT signature algorithm itself, which is
        validated by the server. Refer to ACGS-PGP security documentation for details on
        PQC algorithm negotiation and JWT validation.
    # Standard JWT Bearer for cases where PQC KEM is handled at TLS layer only
    # and JWT uses conventional signatures, or for internal JWTs.
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
```

**Example gRPC Proto with PQC/HE consideration:**

```protobuf
// In rge_internal_service.proto
message EncryptedPIRField {
    string field_path = 1; // JSONPath to the original field
